## <span id="01">Introduction</span>

Beside my academic studies, I always passionated about making projects either is helping me to solve problems or just practice certain skills. Mostly I would just wirte down my ideas on my mac notepad. However, I feel not really efficient because I need to change back and forth between Github project and my notepad to manage my projects. Thus, I came up the idea that I want to build a app that could manage my projects with different status such as completed, working, ...etc.

Later on, I found maybe it could be used with other people which everyone post projects on the room, and other people could ask for joining it or just learned about.
